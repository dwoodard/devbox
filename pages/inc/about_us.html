<h5>
	All Paws is committed to enhancing the quality of life for pets by educating pet owners. Being proactive about your pets health and needs will lead to a long and happy relationship for you and your closest companion.</h5>
<p>
	All Paws Pet Service offers a variety of home health care services for your pet in the comfort of your home! There&#39;s no place like home for healing &amp; enjoying life. When your pets are healthy and happy keep them stress free by having a member of our team come to your home and cater to their needs. When your pet is ill or recovering from an injury, there&#39;s no place they would rather be than home with the people they recognize have formed a bond with.</p>
	
<p>Our company was founded on the belief that pets should have access to quality care when they need it. Caring for a loved one that is in pain or not feeling well is not always the easiest thing to do. At All Paws our compassionate staff is ready to step in and custom build a program to ensure that your pet receives everything they need to recuperate.</p>
