<h4>Top 5 Dog Health Problems</h4>

<p>Arthritis is another human health related dilemma that affects dogs. Due to their generally narrower, longer joints, pure breeds have a tendency to be more predisposed. Routine visits to the vet are important to keeping track of the situation and be alert for deterioration.</p>

<p>Dogs get allergies also. Many dogs are hypersensitive to fleas. Normal symptoms of a flea allergy are hot spots, which can lead to it being infected. If you treat your pet with an anti-flea medicine, this should really help.</p>

<p>Yet another routine dog health problem are infections. Indications that your doggy has an infection are swelling and redness, and a lot of intense itching. Common places for infections are ears, eyes, skin and teeth. Good hygiene is the number one defense against infection. Clean the dog's eyes, ears and teeth often to minimize possibility of infection.</p>

<p>Dog obesity is common but the good news is, it is very treatable. The largest reasons in inducing dog obesity are eating too much and not exercising enough. Fatty food left-overs from the table are a taboo. Control when and how much your pet eats, and walk him often.	</p>
