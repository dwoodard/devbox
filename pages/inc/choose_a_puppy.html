<h4>A Guide to Choosing a Puppy</h4>

<p>Deciding that you wish to own a new young puppy is a thrilling and often chaotic time. Reaching the choice to purchase something that could easily live for the next 12-16 years must be taken seriously and thoroughly thought about. Consequently I have posted a detailed list to make picking a puppy simpler.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choose a well revered breeder that has come recommended, check into their credentials.</li>
    <li>A well respected dog breeder will not sell you a puppy that is poor in any way.</li>
    <li>Before you make that bottom line - ask questions, interview some people that have personally owned the same breed.</li>
    <li>Verify that their are no historical problems associated with that the breed-check the papers (if it is a pedigree.) This is necessary to mention as some breeds are sensitive to cleft pallet, sight and hearing conditions.</li>
    <li>When you have decided on breed and a specific breeder, take a person with you to look into the litter. Always use expert help whenever you can.</li>
    <li>You can find a good breeder by contacting the neighborhood affiliation relating to that breed-or contact the Kennel Club Association.</li>
    <li>Don't go like lightning in to buying a puppy-this is the temptation that many bowwow fanatics do and wind up regretting.</li>
    <li>Look at your personality-are you stubborn? Would a Yorkshire Terrier be ideal for you as they can also be stubborn. Are you very loving and giving-then a Grey Hound maybe ideal. This is a really helpful tip as deciding what personality you are can help make the final choice. If you are particularly stressed and highly strung would a Chihuahua be an ideal pet? I doubt it.</li>
    <li>Do you want to spend hours grooming your dog? If you don't then a Golden Retriever may not be ideal.</li>
    <li>Are you particularly House proud? Then a dog that sheds may not be a good idea.</li>
    <li>Do you live with any allergic reactions? This is exceedingly important as you may be sensitive to dog hair.</li>
</ul>
