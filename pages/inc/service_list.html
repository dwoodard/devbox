		<strong>Hospice Care</strong> 
		The staff at All Paws can provide <em>San Antonio</em> pets with <em>transportation</em> to veterinary appointments, fluids administered in the comfort of their own homes, and will even work with your vet to implement a <em>pain management plan</em> to ensure your pet is happy and lives as pain free as possible.

		<strong>Basic Grooming</strong> 
		Its always a debate, take the dog to the groomer or spend your evening after work scrubbing them down. An All Paws care provider can not only provide a <em>bath</em> and <em>nail trim</em> but can also do <em>more in depth procedures</em> such as anal gland expression and sanitary clips.
